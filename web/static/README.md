Simple HTTP Python server static files
======================================

This directory contains the static files to be served
by the default Python support to the HTTP protocol.

Web designer note:
------------------

I decided to use .html only extension for plain html documents
to distinguish them from Jinja2 templates,
to which is reserved the .htm extension.
